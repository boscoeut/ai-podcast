## 2025-10-02 - Dr. Maya Chen Guest Agent Implementation

**Phase**: Phase 1 - MVP

**Summary**: Implemented Dr. Maya Chen guest agent with academic persona and research-based perspective. Created three core tools (provide_expert_insight, respond_to_question, engage_in_discussion) and integrated with orchestrator to enable multi-agent conversations. This establishes the foundation for guest agent pattern and enables testing of distinct persona voices.

## 2025-10-04 - Persona Configuration System Implementation

**Phase**: Phase 1 - MVP

**Summary**: Implemented the complete persona configuration system enabling dynamic persona management and multi-domain support. Created PersonaConfigManager with YAML loading, validation, and selection capabilities, established technology.yaml with Alex Rivera (host), Dr. Maya Chen, and Jordan Blake (guests), and integrated persona management into orchestrator agent. This foundation enables configurable domain-specific conversations and unlocks implementation of the missing Jordan Blake guest agent.

## 2025-10-04 - Jordan Blake Guest Agent Implementation

**Phase**: Phase 1 - MVP

**Summary**: Implemented Jordan Blake guest agent with entrepreneurial persona and practical business perspective, completing the minimum 2-guest requirement for MVP. Created three distinct tools (provide_practical_insight, share_experience, discuss_implementation) and integrated with orchestrator, establishing clear differentiation between academic (Dr. Maya Chen) and practical (Jordan Blake) perspectives to enable multi-perspective podcast conversations.

## 2025-10-04 - Conversation Loop Engine Implementation

**Phase**: Phase 1 - MVP

**Summary**: Implemented the complete conversation loop engine that orchestrates interactive podcast dialogues between host, guests, and users, completing the MVP core functionality. Created ConversationService with turn-taking logic, ConversationState for session management, and ConversationFormatter for CLI output, enabling natural multi-agent conversations with user participation prompts every 3 exchanges and graceful exit handling. This transforms isolated agent components into a fully functional interactive podcast application.

## 2025-10-04 - Quick Pause Feature Enhancement

**Phase**: Phase 1 - MVP Enhancement

**Summary**: Enhanced conversation flow with natural pause points after each agent speaks, allowing users to chime in at any moment during the conversation. Implemented platform-specific timeout behavior (2-second auto-continue on macOS/Linux, manual on Windows) and simplified the interface by making pauses the only interaction mode. This makes the podcast experience feel like a live, interactive conversation rather than a passive listening experience.

## 2025-10-05 - Dynamic Multiple Guest Selection Implementation

**Phase**: Phase 1 - MVP Enhancement

**Summary**: Implemented dynamic guest selection allowing users to choose 1-5 guests per podcast session from an expanded guest pool of 5 distinct personas (added Sam Martinez, Priya Kapoor, and Marcus Wu to technology domain). Users now specify guest count at startup, and the system dynamically initializes only selected guests and adapts turn-taking logic accordingly. This enables flexible conversation formats from intimate interviews (1 guest) to diverse panel discussions (5 guests) while maintaining backward compatibility with existing 2-guest default.
