# Product Requirements Document: AI-Podcast

> **Note**: This document focuses on product and functional requirements. For technical architecture, implementation details, and development guidelines, see the [Technical Specifications Document](./TECHNICAL_SPECS.MD).

## Executive Summary

AI-Podcast is an interactive, text-based conversational application that simulates a podcast experience with AI-powered hosts and guests. Users can initiate discussions on topics of their choice and participate in dynamic conversations with AI personas that maintain engaging dialogue independently while incorporating user input to guide the discussion.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional podcasts are passive listening experiences where users cannot interact with hosts or guests in real-time. While AI chatbots exist, they typically simulate one-on-one conversations rather than the dynamic, multi-participant environment of a podcast with distinct personalities and perspectives.

---

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Create an engaging, multi-agent conversational experience that simulates a podcast format
2. Enable users to explore topics through dialogue with AI personas with distinct viewpoints
3. Provide an interactive alternative to passive podcast consumption
4. Demonstrate the capabilities of Google's Agent Development Kit for multi-agent orchestration

### Success Criteria
- Users can successfully initiate and participate in podcast conversations
- AI agents maintain distinct, consistent personas throughout conversations
- Conversations remain engaging and on-topic without constant user intervention
- Users can gracefully exit the podcast when desired

---

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Tech enthusiasts, learners, and curious individuals who enjoy podcast-style content and want interactive experiences
- **Secondary**: Developers and AI practitioners interested in multi-agent systems
- **Tertiary**: Content creators exploring AI-assisted ideation and discussion

---

## User Stories

### Core User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to specify a topic for discussion so that the podcast is relevant to my interests.

2. **As a user**, I want to listen to (read) engaging conversations between AI host and guests so that I can learn different perspectives on a topic.

3. **As a user**, I want to ask questions or make comments during the podcast so that I can clarify points or guide the conversation.

4. **As a user**, I want the AI host and guests to have distinct personalities so that the conversation feels natural and multi-dimensional.

5. **As a user**, I want the conversation to continue naturally even when I'm not actively participating so that I can choose when to engage.

6. **As a user**, I want to end the podcast when I'm ready so that I have control over the session duration.

### Future User Stories (Out of Scope for v1)

7. **As a user**, I want to hear the podcast with distinct AI voices so that the experience is more immersive.

8. **As a user**, I want to choose specific guest personas so that I can get perspectives aligned with my interests.

9. **As a user**, I want to save and resume podcast sessions so that I can continue conversations later.

=== AI-PODCAST ===
Welcome! What topic would you like to discuss today?

> The future of work in the age of AI

=================================================

🎙️ ALEX RIVERA (Host):
Welcome to AI-Podcast! I'm your host, Alex Rivera, and today we're diving 
into a fascinating topic: The Future of Work in the Age of AI.

I'm joined by two incredible guests. First, Dr. Maya Chen, researcher and 
academic who studies the intersection of technology and society. And Jordan 
Blake, entrepreneur and practical thinker who's been implementing AI in 
real-world business settings.

Let's jump right in. Maya, from your research perspective, how do you see 
AI fundamentally changing the nature of work?

--------------------------------------------------

👨‍🔬 DR. MAYA CHEN (Guest):
Thanks, Alex. The research is quite clear that we're seeing a shift from 
routine-task automation to cognitive-task augmentation. Studies from MIT 
and Stanford show that AI isn't just replacing jobs—it's transforming how 
we approach problem-solving and creativity...

[Continues for 3-5 exchanges]

--------------------------------------------------

Would you like to join the conversation or continue listening? 
(Type your comment, or press Enter to continue)

> I'm curious about how small businesses can adapt to these changes

--------------------------------------------------

🎙️ ALEX RIVERA (Host):
Great question from our listener! They're asking about small business 
adaptation. Jordan, you work directly with businesses implementing AI. 
What's your take?

👔 JORDAN BLAKE (Guest):
That's exactly where I see the most potential... [continues]

[Conversation continues...]

--------------------------------------------------

Would you like to continue? (Comment or press Enter, type 'stop' to end)

> stop

--------------------------------------------------

🎙️ ALEX RIVERA (Host):
Thanks so much for joining us today! We've explored how AI is reshaping work,
from the research perspective showing cognitive augmentation to practical 
implementation strategies for businesses of all sizes. 

Big thanks to Dr. Maya Chen and Jordan Blake for their insights, and to you,
our listener, for the great questions. Until next time, keep thinking about
the future!
